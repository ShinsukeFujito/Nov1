            <p>Japan in the 19th century was an isolated country and even though Tokugawa bakufu, meaning "tent government," tried to keep it that way by restricting trade with other nations.
                Tokugawa bakufu was a feudal military dictatorship established in 1603 and by the Tokugawa clan until 1868 led by the Shogun, Tokugawa Ieyasu. They had lasted for over 250 years
                 and instituted the policy of <i>sakoku</i>, meaning "closed country," which was a period of isolation from the rest of the world. This isolated Japan for more than 200 years.
