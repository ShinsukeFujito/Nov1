            <p>In the 19th century, Japan was an isolated country and even though Tokugawa bakufu, meaning "tent government," tried to keep it that way by restricting trade with other nations.
                Tokugawa bakufu was a feudal military dictatorship established in 1603 and by the Tokugawa clan until 1868 led by the Shogun, Tokugawa Ieyasu. They had lasted for over 250 years
                 and instituted the policy of <i>sakoku</i>, meaning "closed country," which was a period of isolation from the rest of the world. This isolated Japan for more than 200 years.

                <p><b>Bakumatsu (幕末), which means End of the Shogunate, was the final years of Edo Era and the Tokugawa Shogunate Reign (1603-1867).
                Japan ended its <b>Sakoku</b>, Isolationism, and changed from the feudal Tokugawa Shogunate to <i>modern empire</i> of the Meiji government.
                The major ideological-political divide during this period was between the pro-imperial nationalists called <i>Ishin Shishi</i> (維新志士) and the shogunate forces,
                which included the Elite <a href=“Shinsengumi.html”> Shinsengumi Swordsmen</a>.
                Furthermore, there were two other main driving forces for dissent: first, growing resentment on the part of the tozama daimyō (or outside lords), 
                and second, growing anti-Western sentiment following the arrival of <i>Matthew C. Perry</i>.
                The first related to those lords whose predecessors had fought against Tokugawa forces at the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600, 
                after which they had been permanently excluded from all powerful positions within the shogunate.
                The second was to be expressed in the phrase Sonnō Jōi, or "revere the Emperor, expel the barbarians."
                The turning point of the Bakumatsu was during the Boshin War and the Battle of Toba-Fushimi when pro-shogunate forces were defeated.</p></b>
